# AI Model Training - Execution Summary

## Status: ✅ Ready for Training

All preparation steps have been completed. The dataset is prepared and the training environment is ready.

---

## Completed Steps

### ✅ Phase 1: Dataset Acquisition
- ✅ Downloaded 3 public datasets:
  - Roboflow Pothole Dataset (665 images)
  - Kaggle Pothole Detection Dataset #1 (681 images - needs investigation*)
  - Kaggle Potholes Detection YOLOv8 (1,977 images)
- ✅ Total images successfully ingested: **2,642 images**
- ✅ Total annotated potholes: **9,077**

*Note: First Kaggle dataset had 681 images but only the second one had valid YOLO labels. We have sufficient data without it.

### ✅ Phase 2: Data Preparation
- ✅ Created directory structure for train/valid/test splits
- ✅ Validated YOLO format labels
- ✅ Split dataset: 80% train, 15% valid, 5% test
- ✅ Verified image-label pairs match correctly

### ✅ Phase 3: Training Environment Setup
- ✅ Created `train.py` with full hyperparameter configuration
- ✅ Created `export.py` for TFLite conversion
- ✅ Created `data.yaml` configuration file
- ✅ Prepared Google Colab notebook (recommended approach)
- ✅ Compressed dataset for easy Colab upload (datasets.zip - 759MB)

### ✅ Phase 4: Utility Scripts
- ✅ `ingest_data.py` - Dataset ingestion from zips
- ✅ `dataset_stats.py` - Dataset analysis
- ✅ `visualize_samples.py` - Preview labeled data
- ✅ `prepare_directories.py` - Directory structure setup

### ✅ Phase 5: Documentation
- ✅ Comprehensive Colab training notebook with 11 steps
- ✅ Detailed COLAB_INSTRUCTIONS.md guide
- ✅ Updated README.md with current status
- ✅ Updated main plan document (docs/01-ai-model.md)

## Next Action Required

### Option 1: Train on Google Colab (Recommended)
1. Upload `colab_training_notebook.ipynb` to Google Drive
2. Upload `datasets.zip` to Google Drive (or sync the datasets folder)
3. Open notebook in Colab
4. Set Runtime to GPU (T4)
5. Run all cells sequentially
6. Training time: ~2-3 hours
7. Download `.tflite` file when complete

### Option 2: Train Locally
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run: `python train.py`
3. Training time: 2-3 hours (with GPU) or 15-20 hours (CPU)
4. Export: `python export.py`

## Expected Deliverables

After training completes, you will have:

1. **PyTorch Model** (`best.pt`)
   - Full precision trained weights
   - Can be used for further training or analysis

2. **TFLite Model** (`best_float16.tflite`) **← Primary deliverable**
   - Size: ~6MB
   - Quantization: float16
   - Ready for Android deployment
   - Location to copy: `android/app/src/main/assets/models/`

3. **Training Artifacts**
   - `results.csv` - Epoch-by-epoch metrics
   - `results.png` - Loss and accuracy curves
   - `confusion_matrix.png` - Model evaluation visualization

4. **Performance Metrics** (expected)
   - mAP@50: >75% (target: >80%)
   - mAP@50-95: >40% (target: >50%)
   - Precision: >70% (target: >80%)
   - Recall: >70% (target: >80%)

## Quality Assurance Checklist

Before proceeding to Android development, verify:

- [ ] mAP@50 >= 75%
- [ ] TFLite file size < 10MB
- [ ] Model input shape: [1, 640, 640, 3]
- [ ] Model output shape: [1, 5, 8400]
- [ ] Test inference successful in notebook
- [ ] All files saved to Google Drive
- [ ] `.tflite` file downloaded locally

## Timeline Update

Original Plan: 7 days
Updated Plan: 5 days (skipped local data collection)

| Day | Tasks | Status |
|-----|-------|--------|
| Day 1 | Download and merge datasets | ✅ Complete |
| Day 2 | Pre-processing and validation | ✅ Complete |
| Day 3 | Set up Colab and start training | ⏳ Ready to start |
| Day 4 | Monitor and complete training | 🔜 Pending |
| Day 5 | Export to TFLite and verify | 🔜 Pending |

---

## Fallback Plan

If training results are unsatisfactory (mAP@50 < 75%):

1. **First attempt**: Train for more epochs (150-200)
2. **Second attempt**: Use YOLOv8s (larger, more accurate)
3. **Third attempt**: Adjust hyperparameters (lower learning rate, more augmentation)
4. **Last resort**: Collect local data as originally planned
